## OneAquaHealth: Consolidated Insights from Scientific Papers

This consolidated analysis integrates insights from the reviewed scientific papers, focusing on urban aquatic ecosystems and their connection to human health.

### 1. Patterns, Correlations, and Recurring Themes

- **Urbanization's Negative Impacts**: Urbanization consistently drives environmental degradation, leading to pollution, altered species composition, and reduced resource efficiency in aquatic ecosystems (PMID: 35099004, 34955197, 35283080). 

- **Water Quality as a Health Indicator**: Water quality serves as a critical indicator of ecosystem health and human well-being. Poor water quality correlates with increased disease risks (PMID: 35283080, 37586536, 25889666). 

- **Biodiversity and Ecosystem Health**: Biodiversity metrics, such as species richness and functional diversity, are vital indicators of ecosystem health. Biodiversity decline is linked to urbanization and pollution (PMID: 37586536, 34955197).

- **Importance of Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of aquatic ecosystems is crucial to detect early warning signs of degradation and inform management strategies (PMID: 37586536, 35099004, 37558875).
