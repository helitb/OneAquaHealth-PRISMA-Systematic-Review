Abstract: With a long evolutionary history and a need to adapt to a changing environment, cyanobacteria in freshwater systems use specialized metabolites for communication, defense, and physiological processes. However, the role that these metabolites play in differentiating species, maintaining microbial communities, and generating niche persistence and expansion is poorly understood. Furthermore, many cyanobacterial specialized metabolites and toxins present significant human health concerns due to their liver toxicity and their potential impact to drinking water. Gaps in knowledge exist with respect to changes in species diversity and toxin production during a cyanobacterial bloom (cyanoHAB) event; addressing these gaps will improve understanding of impacts to public and ecological health. In the current project, we utilized a multiomics strategy (DNA metabarcoding and metabolomics) to determine the cyanobacterial community composition, toxin profile, and the specialized metabolite pool at three freshwater lakes in Providence, RI during summer-fall cyanoHABs. Species diversity decreased at all study sites over the course of the bloom event, and toxin production reached a maximum at the midpoint of the event. Additionally, LC-MS/MS-based molecular networking identified new toxin congeners. This work provokes intriguing questions with respect to the use of allelopathy by organisms in these systems and the presence of emerging toxic compounds that can impact public health.

paper_aim:	The paper aims to understand the dynamics of cyanobacterial blooms in urban lakes, including species succession, toxin production, and the relationship between these factors. 

OAH_indicators:	The paper mentions cyanobacterial biomass, toxin concentrations, and metabolite content as indicators. Cyanobacterial biomass was measured by relative abundances of cyanobacterial taxa. Toxin concentrations were determined by AUC values from mass spec data. Metabolite content was measured by LC-MS/MS. 

geolocation:	The paper focuses on Dianchi Lake, China, which is located in Asia. 

methodology:	The paper employed a multi-faceted approach, combining various techniques like DNA metabarcoding, metabolomics, microscopy, toxin analysis, LC-MS/MS networking, and principal component analysis. This allowed for a comprehensive study of cyanobacterial community composition, toxin production, and specialized metabolite pools. 

key_findings:	The paper investigates the temporal dynamics of cyanobacterial blooms in urban lakes, focusing on species succession, diversity, and toxin production. The study found that cyanobacterial community composition shifted over time, with diverse filamentous species dominating early in the bloom and Aphanizomenon sp. becoming dominant later. Species diversity decreased as the bloom progressed. The study also identified 14 cyanotoxins, including microcystin-LR, MC-LA, anabaenopeptin A, and ferintoic acid A. Toxin concentrations were highest during peak biomass, indicating that toxin production was not constitutive. The paper highlights the importance of monitoring cyanobacterial blooms in urban lakes and the need for further research on the genus Woronichinia, which showed high abundance and potential for producing cyanopeptides. 

population:	The text focuses on cyanobacteria blooms in lakes and their impact on water quality. It mentions specific species like Microcystis sp. and Aphanizomenon sp., but doesn't provide information about the population's characteristics like number, species, age, etc. 

relations:	The paper investigates the relationship between cyanobacterial blooms and their associated toxins. The study found that as cyanobacterial blooms progress, species diversity decreases, while toxin production increases. This suggests a link between species diversity and toxin production, where a decrease in diversity leads to an increase in toxin production. The study also found that toxin production is not constitutive, but rather is triggered by specific environmental conditions. Additionally, the study identified new toxin congeners, highlighting the importance of understanding the full suite of toxins produced during bloom events.

Abstract: Urbanization poses numerous challenges to freshwater biodiversity. This paper describes two studies with the joint aim of demonstrating the benefits of applying a systematic behaviour change framework and providing the foundational knowledge to inform future behavior change work to protect and restore urban freshwater biodiversity. In Study 1 we used a mixed-methods research design, involving 14 key informant interviews followed by an online survey targeting 17 freshwater biodiversity experts and another targeting a representative sample of 550 urban residents, to identify and prioritize the most promising resident behaviors to target to reduce stormwater pollution and improve natural waterway habitats in urban areas. Study 2 focused on the top-ranked short-term behavior identified in Study 1, citizen reporting of pollution in stormwater drains and waterways. We surveyed a representative sample of 1901 urban residents across Aoteraoa New Zealand to identify four main determinants influencing this behavior: awareness and uncertainty about reporting, lack of opportunity to report, social motivation and personal motivation to report, and five potential target audiences: 'Supportive', 'Unaware but receptive', 'Motivated but lack support', 'Reluctant', and 'Not my problem'. We make recommendations for the most appropriate intervention designs to target each of these audience segments to promote the reporting of stormwater pollution in urban areas. This knowledge will allow for a more coordinated and effective approach for addressing the 'human element' that lies at the heart of many urban freshwater management problems.

Abstract: Light pollution caused by artificial light at night (ALAN) is increasingly recognized as a major driver of global environmental change. Since emissions are rapidly growing in an urbanizing world and half of the human population lives close to a freshwater shoreline, rivers and lakes are ever more exposed to light pollution worldwide. However, although light conditions are critical to aquatic species, and freshwaters are biodiversity hotspots and vital to human well-being, only a small fraction of studies conducted on ALAN focus on these ecosystems. The effects of light pollution on freshwaters are broad and concern all levels of biodiversity. Experiments have demonstrated diverse behavioural and physiological responses of species, even at low light levels. Prominent examples are skyglow effects on diel vertical migration of zooplankton and the suppression of melatonin production in fish. However, responses vary widely among taxa, suggesting consequences for species distribution patterns, potential to create novel communities across ecosystem boundaries, and cascading effects on ecosystem functioning. Understanding, predicting and alleviating the ecological impacts of light pollution on freshwaters requires a solid consideration of the physical properties of light propagating in water and a multitude of biological responses. This knowledge is urgently needed to develop innovative lighting concepts, mitigation strategies and specifically targeted measures. This article is part of the theme issue 'Light pollution in complex ecological systems'.

Abstract: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic had huge impacts on global urban populations, activity and health, yet little is known about attendant consequences for urban river ecosystems. We detected significant changes in occurrence and risks from contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in waterways across Greater London (UK) during the pandemic. We were able to rapidly identify and monitor large numbers of CECs in n = 390 samples across 2019-2021 using novel direct-injection liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry methods for scalable targeted analysis, suspect screening and prioritisation of CEC risks. A total of 10,029 measured environmental concentrations (MECs) were obtained for 66 unique CECs. Pharmaceutical MECs decreased during lockdown in 2020 in the R. Thames (p </= 0.001), but then increased significantly in 2021 (p </= 0.01). For the tributary rivers, the R. Lee, Beverley Brook, R. Wandle and R. Hogsmill were the most impacted, primarily via wastewater treatment plant effluent and combined sewer overflows. In the R. Hogsmill in particular, pharmaceutical MEC trends were generally correlated with NHS prescription statistics, likely reflecting limited wastewater dilution. Suspect screening of  approximately  1,200 compounds tentatively identified 25 additional CECs at the five most impacted sites, including metabolites such as O-desmethylvenlafaxine, an EU Watch List compound. Lastly, risk quotients (RQs) >/= 0.1 were calculated for 21 compounds across the whole Greater London freshwater catchment, of which seven were of medium risk (RQ >/= 1.0) and three were in the high-risk category (RQ >/= 10), including imidacloprid (RQ = 19.6), azithromycin (15.7) and diclofenac (10.5). This is the largest spatiotemporal dataset of its kind for any major capital city globally and the first for Greater London, representing  approximately  16 % of the population of England, and delivering a foundational One-Health case study in the third largest city in Europe across a global pandemic.

key_findings:	The paper found that the COVID-19 pandemic had a mixed impact on the occurrence of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in the River Thames and its tributaries. Some CECs, particularly pharmaceuticals, decreased during the 2020 lockdown period, likely due to reduced human activity and migration. However, concentrations exceeded pre-pandemic levels the following year. The study also identified the chemical signatures of treated wastewater and CSOs/raw wastewater discharges, with the Beverley Brook and the River Hogsmill being the most impacted sites by both wastewater source types.  The study found that some pharmaceuticals, including antidepressants and antipsychotics, showed increased prescriptions during the pandemic, but only some of these were reflected in riverine concentrations.  The study also found that imidacloprid, azithromycin, and diclofenac posed the highest risk to aquatic life.

Abstract: Owing to a long history of anthropogenic pressures, freshwater ecosystems are among the most vulnerable to biodiversity loss(1). Mitigation measures, including wastewater treatment and hydromorphological restoration, have aimed to improve environmental quality and foster the recovery of freshwater biodiversity(2). Here, using 1,816 time series of freshwater invertebrate communities collected across 22 European countries between 1968 and 2020, we quantified temporal trends in taxonomic and functional diversity and their responses to environmental pressures and gradients. We observed overall increases in taxon richness (0.73% per year), functional richness (2.4% per year) and abundance (1.17% per year). However, these increases primarily occurred before the 2010s, and have since plateaued. Freshwater communities downstream of dams, urban areas and cropland were less likely to experience recovery. Communities at sites with faster rates of warming had fewer gains in taxon richness, functional richness and abundance. Although biodiversity gains in the 1990s and 2000s probably reflect the effectiveness of water-quality improvements and restoration projects, the decelerating trajectory in the 2010s suggests that the current measures offer diminishing returns. Given new and persistent pressures on freshwater ecosystems, including emerging pollutants, climate change and the spread of invasive species, we call for additional mitigation to revive the recovery of freshwater biodiversity.

paper_aim:	The paper aims to analyze long-term trends in biodiversity metrics of European aquatic macroinvertebrates and assess the influence of environmental drivers on these trends. 

OAH_indicators:	The paper mentions the following biodiversity indicators: Shannon's diversity, rarefied taxon richness, functional divergence, and Rao's quadratic entropy. These indicators were measured at 1,816 biologically independent sites. 

geolocation:	The paper focuses on Europe. 

methodology:	The paper used a comprehensive dataset of time series data from European ecologists and environmental managers. They analyzed trends in taxonomic and functional diversity metrics using a moving window approach. Hierarchical Bayesian models were used to estimate trends and identify drivers of change in abundance and taxonomic and functional diversity of Europe’s freshwater invertebrate communities. 

key_findings:	The paper found that freshwater invertebrate communities in Europe have experienced a period of recovery in terms of taxonomic and functional diversity, particularly in the 1990s and 2000s. However, this recovery has stalled in recent years, with trends in taxon richness and functional richness plateauing or even declining. The study also found that freshwater communities downstream of dams, urban areas, and cropland were less likely to experience recovery, and that communities at sites with faster rates of warming had fewer gains in diversity. The authors suggest that current mitigation measures are offering diminishing returns and call for additional efforts to revive the recovery of freshwater biodiversity. 

population:	The study involved a meta-analysis of 1,816 time series of freshwater macroinvertebrate communities. 

relations:	The paper explores the relationship between various indicators of freshwater ecosystem health, including water quality, flow regulation, climate change, and biodiversity. The authors argue that these indicators are interconnected and that changes in one can have cascading effects on others. For example, climate change can alter water flow patterns, which can impact water quality and biodiversity. Similarly, dam construction can disrupt natural flow regimes, leading to changes in water quality and the composition of invertebrate communities. The paper emphasizes the need for an integrated approach to freshwater management that considers the complex interactions between these indicators.
