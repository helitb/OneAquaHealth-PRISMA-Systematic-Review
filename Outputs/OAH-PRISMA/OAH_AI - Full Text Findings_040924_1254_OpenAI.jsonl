However, the role that these metabolites play in differentiating species, maintaining microbial communities, and generating niche persistence and expansion is poorly understood. Furthermore, many cyanobacterial specialized metabolites and toxins present significant human health concerns due to their liver toxicity and their potential impact to drinking water. Gaps in knowledge exist with respect to changes in species diversity and toxin production during a cyanobacterial bloom (cyanoHAB) event; addressing these gaps will improve understanding of impacts to public and ecological health. In the current project, we utilized a multiomics strategy (DNA metabarcoding and metabolomics) to determine the cyanobacterial community composition, toxin profile, and the specialized metabolite pool at three freshwater lakes in Providence, RI during summer-fall cyanoHABs. Species diversity decreased at all study sites over the course of the bloom event, and toxin production reached a maximum at the midpoint of the event.

Mitigation measures, including wastewater treatment and hydromorphological restoration, have aimed to improve environmental quality and foster the recovery of freshwater biodiversity(2). Here, using 1,816 time series of freshwater invertebrate communities collected across 22 European countries between 1968 and 2020, we quantified temporal trends in taxonomic and functional diversity and their responses to environmental pressures and gradients. We observed overall increases in taxon richness (0.73% per year), functional richness (2.4% per year) and abundance (1.17% per year). However, these increases primarily occurred before the 2010s, and have since plateaued. Freshwater communities downstream of dams, urban areas and cropland were less likely to experience recovery. Communities at sites with faster rates of warming had fewer gains in taxon richness, functional richness and abundance. Although biodiversity gains in the 1990s and 2000s probably reflect the effectiveness of water-quality improvements and restoration projects, the decelerating trajectory in the 2010s suggests that the current measures offer diminishing returns. Given new and persistent pressures on freshwater ecosystems, including emerging pollutants, climate change and the spread of invasive species, we call for additional mitigation to revive the recovery of freshwater biodiversity."}, "domain": "TBD", "OAH_score": {"score": 9, "rationale": "The paper focuses on the long-term trends of freshwater invertebrate communities in Europe, analyzing the impact of climate change, dam construction, and urbanization on biodiversity.

It also seeks to understand the dynamics of these communities over time, focusing on the impacts of anthropogenic factors and climate change, while employing statistical models to evaluate biodiversity metrics and their drivers.", "OAH_indicators": "The indicators mentioned in the paper include Shannon\u2019s diversity, rarefied taxon richness, functional divergence, and Rao\u2019s quadratic entropy (Q). These biodiversity metrics were measured across 1,816 biologically independent sites, with the effects of environmental drivers such as annual maximum temperature, annual precipitation, dam impacts, and land use considered in the analysis.", "geolocation": "The paper focuses on Europe.", "methodology": "The methodology/design used in the paper includes statistical analyses with specific requirements for reporting, such as sample size, measurement details, statistical tests, covariates, assumptions, and effect sizes. Data collection did not involve any software, while data analysis was conducted using annotated R (version 4.2.2). Additionally, all scripts related to the analysis are available on GitHub. The paper also includes a data availability statement detailing the accessibility of metadata, site characteristics, trend estimates, and raw biodiversity data.", "key_findings": "The paper presents several key findings regarding freshwater biodiversity trends in Europe. It reports an overall increase in taxon richness, functional richness, and abundance of freshwater invertebrate communities from 1968 to 2020, although these increases plateaued after the 2010s. Communities located downstream of dams, urban areas, and cropland showed less recovery, and areas experiencing faster warming had fewer gains in biodiversity. While there were positive trends in overall biodiversity, declines were noted at many sites, with taxon richness declining at 30% of sites and abundance at 39%.\n\nFunctional diversity increased over the study period, but both functional evenness and taxonomic evenness declined. The presence of non-native species increased sharply at sites where they were detected. The findings suggest that past mitigation measures improved water quality and biodiversity, but recovery has slowed due to ongoing pressures such as climate change, land-use intensification, and emerging pollutants.\n\nThe paper emphasizes the need for targeted management actions to protect biodiversity, particularly in areas at risk from urbanization, agriculture, and dam construction. It advocates for substantial changes in land management practices, investments in sewage and wastewater treatment, and a catchment-scale approach to enhance conservation efforts. Standardized, long-term biodiversity monitoring is highlighted as essential for tracking changes and identifying high-risk sites. Overall, the findings underscore the importance of addressing environmental stressors to promote biodiversity recovery in freshwater ecosystems.", "population": "The studied population's characteristics do not apply to this study.", "relations": "The key findings of the paper reveal a complex interplay between various indicators of freshwater biodiversity, particularly taxonomic richness, functional richness, and abundance of invertebrate communities. Over the study period, taxon richness and abundance showed overall increases, but these trends plateaued after the 2010s, indicating a halt in recovery. While taxon richness increased at some sites, a significant proportion experienced declines, highlighting a disparity in trends across different locations.\n\nFunctional richness also exhibited positive trends until around 2012, after which it stabilized, suggesting that improvements in ecosystem functioning may have reached a limit. Despite increases in functional diversity, both functional evenness and taxonomic evenness declined, indicating an imbalance in the distribution of functional traits.\n\nEnvironmental factors, such as climate change and human activities like urbanization and agriculture, significantly influenced these biodiversity metrics. Warmer temperatures were associated with increased taxon richness, while urban areas and cropland negatively impacted both taxonomic and functional richness. The presence of non-native species further complicated these dynamics, as their richness and abundance increased, potentially affecting native species metrics.\n\nOverall, the findings emphasize the interconnectedness of taxonomic and functional diversity, illustrating how changes in community composition and environmental conditions can influence the ecological roles of freshwater invertebrate communities. The study underscores the need for integrated management strategies to address the multiple stressors affecting biodiversity and to support recovery efforts in freshwater ecosystems.", "ODH_keys": ["One Health", "digital health"], "ODH_perspectives": ["individual health and well-being", "population and society", "ecosystem"], "ODH_dimensions": ["environment", "human health care"]}, "ODH_score": {"score": 2, "rationale": "The paper focuses on a meta-analysis of freshwater macroinvertebrate communities, examining biodiversity trends over time and across Europe.
